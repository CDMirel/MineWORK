MineWORK
========

  A VERY lightwieght "framework" that uses the SMARTY templating system with custom libraries for generic website tasks such as logging in, creating tables, inserting data, and more tasks that don't need to be recoded time after time.

  This project doesn't aim to try to outshine big frameworks - rather be useful for small or medium sized projects that demand speed, and usability.

  All of the classes and functions are easy to use and get a grasp of. All database interactions are PDO prepared statements (true prepared, not emulated). Passwords are encrypted with the newest security standard, Bcrypt.



Usage
-----

Using this project is very easy. Simply download the files into a new root web directory, and then navigate to the libs/config.php file to edit your configuration settings. They are all explained in the file. If you are having trouble with HTML and this templating engine, refer to smarty's documentation.
